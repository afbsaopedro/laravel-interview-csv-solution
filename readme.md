# Technical Challenge

The challenge is something simple that will check your
logic skills and code structure.

You will find two files available in the repo.

- **_data.csv_** (that holds more recent data)
- **_oldData.csv_** (that holds previous data)

The challenge if you wish to accept it is the following.

```lolypop

Using Laravel PHP you will build a system that will accept the upload of
the two files and check the differences between the two.

After upload of the two files the output should result on the following data:

- the rows that are exact match on both files
- the rows that were updated
- The rows that are new data

```

`The challenge has a deadline your code must be committed to the
github repository by the end of the day of the 15 of August 2024.`

All the best.
